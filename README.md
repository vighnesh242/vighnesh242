## Hi there I'm Vighnesh Gosavi👋

Data Enthusiast | Aspiring Data Engineer | Occasional Debug Philosopher

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where SQL queries flow like poetry, Python scripts break (and then get fixed), and dashboards tell stories better than words.

🔍 About Me
💡 I love turning raw data into actionable insights and making sense of the chaos hidden in databases.
💾 Experienced with SQL, Python, AWS, Data Pipelines, and BI Dashboards.
📊 Passionate about data visualization, machine learning, and cloud technologies.
🐞 Occasionally find myself debugging life decisions along with code.

🚀 What You'll Find Here
🛠️ Data Engineering Projects: Pipelines, ETL workflows, and cloud-based architectures.
📊 Analytics Dashboards: Because spreadsheets deserve a glow-up.
🤖 Machine Learning Models: Some are great, some are… learning.
🎢 Random Experiments: Because curiosity sometimes leads to genius (or infinite loops).
💡 Current Focus
🔹 Building scalable data pipelines (because clean data = happy analysts).
🔹 Cloud technologies & AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena, QuickSight).
🔹 Machine Learning & Statistical Models (to make predictions that might actually be right).

🌐 Personal Website: [Coming Soon™]
